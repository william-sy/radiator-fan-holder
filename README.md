# radiator-fan-holder
A simple plastic holder to hang fans under your radiator to get more out of the convection.

# Info

Currently This project is at V4, Where the first 3 versions were made in tinkercad.
Now here is my first project in openscad for the same thing but better.

## Why

Well the heatpump benefits from floor heating and special radiators built for low temp water. This is a big investment, and something we have put off for now. We looked online for solutions and found a few:
- A 50 bucks per 3 fans speedcomfort
- A DIY project: [URL](https://www.conrad.nl/info/guides/zelfbouwprojecten/cv-met-ventilatoren)

I am sure there are more, But I wanted something small, compact, and ideally not so visible.

## Fans

You can generate 3 sizes of fan holder 40,80 and 120mm fans.
There is a 80MM fan STL file already available for you.

The 80 mm fan fits nicely under a type 22, the 40 under a type 20 / 21 and the 120 under a type 33.

## ToDo
- A  fan controller mount, This would be nice so this does not dangle on one of cable management loops in the back

## Nice to have
- A bracket for the power supply, not perse needed, but would be nice.

# Pictures of radiator fan holder V3

Top over view (yes the fans do get dirty, and they are mounted upside down here) The holes in the center are for a piece of wire to route trough the radiator and thus make sure it keeps hanging.

Here is a side view, you can see the front plate stickout, this is to hold onto the lip of the radiator, providing you with a simple mounting place.

# Generate a other size
By opening the code in openscad you can change the `fan` parameter to the desired size you want, press `F6` to render and you are all ready to export to STL
